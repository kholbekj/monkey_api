This is a pretty silly API.
It exposes and manipulates monkeys.
It does so RESTfully.
It does so with CSV as it's datastore.
It doesn't care about your wories.
It does what it does.

To run (why!?) `gem install sinatra` if you haven't already, and just `ruby main.rb` from the root.

Then you got your golden CRUD actions on localhost:4567/monkeys

Best of luck.
